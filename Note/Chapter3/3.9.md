Figure 3.19
```
employee (_ID_, person name, street, city)
works (_ID_, company name, salary)
company (_company name_, city)
manages (_ID_, manager id)
```

### a. Find the ID, name, and city of residence of each employee who works for “First Bank Corporation”.
```sql
SELECT e.ID, e.person_name, e.city
FROM employee e
JOIN works w ON e.ID = w.ID
WHERE w.company_name = 'First Bank Corporation';
```

### b. Find the ID, name, and city of residence of each employee who works for “First Bank Corporation” and earns more than $10000.
```sql
SELECT E.ID_, E.person_name, E.city
FROM employee E
JOIN works W ON E.ID = W.ID
WHERE W.company_name = 'First Bank Corporation' AND W.salary > 10000;

```

### c. Find the ID of each employee who does not work for “First Bank Corporation”.
```sql
SELECT e.ID
FROM employee e
WHERE e.ID NOT IN(
    SELECT ID
    FROM work
    WHERE company_name='First Bank Corporation'
);
```

d. Find the ID of each employee who earns more than every employee of “Small Bank Corporation”.
```sql

WHERE e.ID = NOT IN(
    SELECT w1.ID
    FROM work w1 
    --w1이 Small Bank Corporation의 work
    WHERE w1.company_name = 'Small Bank Corporation'
    AND Max(w1.salary)> (
        SELECT w2.salary

        WHERE w2.company_name <> 'Small Bank Corporation' )
);
```

e. Assume that companies may be located in several cities. Find the name of each company that is located in every city in which “Small Bank Corporation” is located.

    FROM company s
    WHERE s.company_name='Small Bank Corporation'

```

f. Find the name of the company that has the most employees (or companies, in the case where there is a tie for the most).
```sql
SELECT C.company_name
FROM company C
JOIN works W ON C.company_name = W.company_name
GROUP BY C.company_name
HAVING COUNT(W.ID) = (
    SELECT MAX(emp_count)
    FROM (
        SELECT COUNT(ID) AS emp_count
        FROM works
        GROUP BY company_name
    ) AS employee_counts

```

g. Find the name of each company whose employees earn a higher salary,
on average, than the average salary at “First Bank Corporation”
```sql
SELECT c1.company_name
FROM company c1
JOIN work w1 on c1.company_name = w1.company_name
GROUP BY c1.company_name
HAVING AVG(w1.salary) > (
    SELECT AVG(w2.salary)
    -- w2.company_name='First Bank Corporation'의 평균을 계산
    FROM work w2
    WHERE w2.company_name='First Bank Corporation'

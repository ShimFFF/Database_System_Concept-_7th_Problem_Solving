 Consider the relational database of Figure 3.19. Give an expression in SQL for each of the following:

a. Modify the database so that the employee whose ID is '12345' now lives
in “Newtown”.

b. Give each manager of “First Bank Corporation” a 10 percent raise unless
the salary becomes greater than $100000; in such cases, give only a 3
percent raise.
